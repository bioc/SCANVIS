Description: SCANVIS is a set of annotation-dependent tools for analyzing
splice junctions and their read support as predetermined by an alignment
tool of choice (for example, STAR aligner). SCANVIS assesses relative
read support (RRS) for a splice junction by relating it to the context of 
local split reads aligning to annotated transcripts. Furthermore,
SCANVIS also deeply annotates each splice junction, indicating whether the 
junction is supported by annotation or not, and if not, what type of 
junction it is (e.g. exon skipping, alternative 5' or 3' events, 
Novel Exons). Unannotated junctions are also futher annotated by indicating 
whether it induces a frame shift or not. SCANVIS also has a visualization 
function that allows users to quickly generate static sashimi-style plots
that clearly depict relative read support and actual read support using
arc thickness and arc heights, making it easy for users to spot
well-supported junctions. These plots also clearly delineate 
unannotated junctions from annotated ones using designated color schemes,
and users can also highlight splice junctions of choice. 
Variants and/or a read profile are also incoroporated if the user 
supplies variants in bed format and the BAM file.
One further feature of the visualization function is that users
can visualize multiple samples of a certain disease or cohort in a single
figure - this occurs via a "merge" function wherein junction details 
over multiple samples are merged to generate a single sashimi plot, which
is useful when contrasting cohorots (eg. disease vs control).
